# vec_container
Writing the STL container std::vector from scratch.
I didn't seperate implementations from declarations as far as I don't consider it as a necessity.
This is my first ever repository on github, so I decided to fill it with something fundamental.

Functions that are to be written.
vector::swap
analogue of std::swap for vectors(non-member function).
